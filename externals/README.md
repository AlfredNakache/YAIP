## Externals ##

There are a few externals used, but not inside of <code>YAIP++</code>.

* [biicode](https://github.com/biicode/misc "biicode") aims to master [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ "Travis CI") - not very successful at the moment :-(
* [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch "Catch") is used for tests - this works pretty good.
* [CMake-codecov](https://github.com/RWTH-ELP/CMake-codecov "CMake-codecov") aims for code coverage - depends very strong on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ "Travis CI") and the configuration for it.
